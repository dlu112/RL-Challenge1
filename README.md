# RL-Challenge1

## Objective
Develop an algorithm, accompanied by unit tests, that is capable of searching a
matrix of dimensions m x n for a specified number in logarithmic or better
time complexity.

Each row within the matrix is sorted in ascending order, and the first number
of each row is larger than the last number of the preceding row.
